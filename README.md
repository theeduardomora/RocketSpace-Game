# RocketSpace-Game
A small, unfinished game that I created as a project. Built on SFML graphics library. 

To play the game, extract all contents listed here to a folder and run the RocketSpace executable. If visual studio is installed on your computer along with Windows 
OS, this program should work. Otherwise, Main.cpp under src will have to be compiled and ran from said compiler. 
I hope you enjoy! Updates to this game may come in the distant future, including a possible improved, polished mobile game version.
