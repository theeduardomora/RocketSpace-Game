# RocketSpace-Game
A small, unfinished game that I created as a project. Built with SFML graphics library. 

To play the game, extract all contents listed here to a folder and run the RocketSpace executable. It is a bit buggy, so try to enlarge 
window of the excutable and don't move/click mouse after you click the "START" button while the program is giving out instructions to the player.
After that, program should work fine. Keep moving your rocket up while collecting collectibles to upgrade your rocket. There is one boss included. 

Executable only works on Windows OS.
